          The MAS Swim Badges programme gives your child a clear, step-by-step
          path in the water — and a badge that means the same thing at every
          recognised centre in Malaysia.

        Each badge — from Starfish through Dolphin — marks a defined set of skills.
        Your child is prepared by their instructor and then assessed by an
        independent examiner, so the badge reflects a genuinely met standard, not
        just attendance. Every certificate carries a unique serial you can check
        online at any time.
      </p>

      <header className="mas-page-head mas-section-head"><h2>Child safety</h2></header>
      <p className="mas-lede">
        Assessments are conducted by independent examiners under
        conflict-of-interest rules, and your child’s personal details are never
        shown publicly. Verification works by serial only — the registry can’t be
        browsed for children’s names — so a certificate can be confirmed without
        exposing any private information.

        Find a recognised centre near you and enrol. When your child earns a
        badge, you’ll receive a claim code to link their record to your own
        account, where you can view their badges and verify each certificate.
