// src/data/searchIndex.ts
// Single source-of-truth, static content index for site-wide search across the
// PUBLIC marketing site only. Page titles, section headings, key body copy, FAQs,
// Guides and the level pathway are indexed here.
//
// SAFETY: this module indexes the public site's OWN page copy only. It must never
// reference candidate, certificate, member, or any minor data — those live behind
// the portal's RLS surfaces and are out of bounds for search. Keep it that way.
//
// Maintainability:
//   - FAQ, Guide and Level entries are DERIVED from their existing source-of-truth
//     data modules (faqs.ts, guides.ts, levels.ts) so they never drift out of sync.
//   - Static page copy (Home, About, For parents, …) has no data module behind it,
//     so those entries are hand-authored below in PAGE_ENTRIES. To add or edit a
//     page entry, edit that one array.
